    <p >
      I am someone who loves hobbies. I always make it a habit to atleast learn
      one new skill every summer vaction that we get.
      Be it something to do with arts and crafts or something like hiking.But if
      you ask me my top three hobbies, then i would have to think for a bit.<br /><br />
      My top three most favotite hobbies:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Reading: this is a hobby that always brings me a sense of peace.
          reading a good book feels like a cup of tea after a long day of very
          heavy rain. its comfort. bliss.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Binge Watching: after a long week of stressful work filled with assignments and deadlines, 
          i just find myself wanting to relax. i can do so by just 
          opening one of my many favorite ott platforms and choosing a series that feels like home. 
          going on a watch marathon is my kind of vacation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Travelling: who doesnt love travelling. everyone does and that most definitely includes me.
          i am someone if given the change would book a weekend getaway every single saturday sunday 
          that i encounter. 
        </li>
      </ol>
